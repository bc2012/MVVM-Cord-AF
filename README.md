# MVVM-Cord-AF
Example of MVVM, Coordinator and Alamofire

I have recently been learning the MVVM and Coordinator patterns. As an exercise I took this AlamoFire tutorial by Corey Davis on Ray Wendrlich (https://www.raywenderlich.com/6587213-alamofire-5-tutorial-for-ios-getting-started) and converted it to adhere to these patterns.

This repository contains the results of that exercise so that it may be of use in helping others who are learning these patterns.
